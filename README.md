IDEA9103 Creative Coding Major Project (Individual Task)

## Part 1

## Part 2:
I've chosen to animate our group's code using **Perlin noise** due to its exceptional creative potential. Perlin noise offers a dynamic and versatile toolset for creative coding, renowned for its ability to simulate intricate and organic patterns. By harnessing Perlin noise, we can generate visually captivating effects that breathe life into our project.

I've chosen Perlin noise because of its potential to simulate waves and reflections on water surfaces, which I thought would be ideal for bringing life to the picture, considering that half of the image comprises water. Since Perlin noise is typically used to generate smoothly varying values that can simulate natural phenomena, such as waves or organic patterns, I believed that incorporating it into the positions of the lines could help create an animated effect that mimics the behavior of these natural elements.
